# Image Cleaning and SSIM Evaluation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project performs **image cleaning** and then evaluates the similarity between the original and processed images using the **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)**. SSIM is a perceptual metric that measures image quality degradation, commonly used for comparing image processing outputs.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ§¼ **Image Cleaning**: Removes noise, normalizes images, or applies custom preprocessing.
- ðŸ–¤ **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts images to grayscale for consistent SSIM computation.
- ðŸ“Š **SSIM Calculation**: Computes SSIM scores to assess similarity between original and cleaned images.

## ðŸš€ Usage

- Run the script:

   ```bash
   python image_cleaning_ssim.py

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Python 3.x

Required libraries:

pip install opencv-python scikit-image numpy
